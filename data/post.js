        title:"10th Medlab Induction Ceremony",
        fullDescription:`A milestone has been reached, transitioning from classroom students to medical scientists, certified and qualified in character and learning. The medical laboratory Department inducted 81 students into the Profession.
        The president Vice Chancellor in his opening remarks pointed out that medical laboratory scientists are indispensable as they are needed solely in the medical line because without them performing tests on the patients, the actual cause of an illness cannot be determined. He urged them to remember that society cannot prosper by doing what is being done repeatedly, but to create something new, to devote their energy to the profession. He has charged them to remain diligent and advised them to be humble as humility pays.
        Having been sworn in and taken the oath of allegiance by the Registrar Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria,Dr. Tosan Erabor who was represented, the Medlab graduates are now Medical Scientists.
